      <p>My name is Varun Master and I am graduate of the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp which was 12-week long intensive program focused on full-stack development. In this program, we learned and implemented multiple projects using HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, Firebase, Node.Js, MySQL, MongoDB, Express, Handelbars.js and ReactJS. </p>

      <p>I have experience working in the software industry. I worked on the Client-Support team where I helped maintain and trouble production issues using logs and SQL queries. Additionally, I was the deployment manager that oversaw all code and patch releases using Octopus Deploy and AdminConsole. </p>

      <p>I have a passion for technology and building sleek applications. I am a highly motivated and quick learner who is constantly improving their skill-set. With my critical thinking and problem-solving skills, I enjoy facing challenges and coming up with simple and elegant solutions. I have the necessary skills to design, execute, and maintain applications while working in a collaborative and diverse team environment.</p>
